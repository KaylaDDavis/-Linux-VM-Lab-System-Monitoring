# 🖥️ Home Lab Virtualization & Linux System Monitoring

## Overview

Welcome to my home lab project! This repository documents my personal virtualization setup and a Linux system monitoring project hosted within my home lab. The goal is to demonstrate my hands-on skills in virtualization, system administration, and monitoring.

## 💻 Home Lab Setup

I am currently running a Windows-based host machine with a virtual machine environment to test, learn, and experiment with various technologies. 

**Host System Specs:**
- **OS:** Windows 10/11 Pro
- **CPU:** [Insert CPU model here]
- **RAM:** [Insert RAM amount here]
- **Storage:** [Insert storage size/type here]
- **Virtualization Software:** [Hyper-V / VMware Workstation / VirtualBox — pick one]
- **Networking:** [Wired/wireless, mention details if relevant]

**Guest VM:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu Linux [version]
- **Resources Allocated:** [e.g., 2 cores, 4GB RAM]
- **Purpose:** System monitoring, scripting, and lab exercises

**Photos of my home lab will be added soon.**

## 📊 Linux System Monitoring Project

Inside my guest Linux VM, I built a lightweight system resource monitoring solution using Bash and Python. This tool collects and reports on:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk space
- Running processes
- (Optional) Alerts for high usage thresholds

The data is logged at regular intervals using cron, making it easy to track system health over time. 

### Project Files
- `monitor.sh` → Bash script for system metrics
- `monitor.py` → Python script (optional advanced version)
- `sample_logs/` → Sample logs captured from monitoring runs
- `screenshots/` → Screenshots of monitoring in action (to be added)

## 📸 Screenshots

I will update this section with screenshots demonstrating:
- My VM running in the virtualization interface
- Terminal views of `htop` or `glances`
- The monitoring script in action
- Log file examples
- Optional resource usage graphs

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Improve the monitoring script to include email/Slack alerts
- Automate chart generation from the log data
- Expand the project to monitor multiple VMs or Docker containers
- Publish a blog post or walkthrough about the lab build process
